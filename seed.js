    review:'With Olive Garden its always hit or miss. Sometimes the noodles are slightly burned sometimes the sauce is a bit to heavy or sometimes theres not enough. In general for this dish the sauce is to heavy and sometimes the shrimp and scallops that comes with this dish are over cooked. I would not recommend this dish the next time you go to your local Olive Garden.'

    price:'$13.95',
    rating:'4/5',
    review:'The quality of a pho bowl can be narrowed down to 2 things. The broth and the noodles. If one is off in anyway then the pho can only be considered average even if one of the 2 is supurb. In this case both the noodles and the broth complement each other nicely. The broth is not overy salty or rich which can be a problem, and the noodles have a very light texture that does not get soggy as time goes on.'

    review:'A very good noodle dish on a cold day. The soup is very light yet rich in flavor, while the noodles are very firm and absorb the flavor of the seaweed soup. Can come topped with chicken for an extra dollar or tempura for and extra 2 dollars.'

    rating:'3.5/5',
    review:"If you are looking for traditional authentic Asian cuisine then you have come to the right place. This dish which is very popular in Xi'An and Beijing is a very distinct and heavy flavor that is contributed by the szechuan sauce and pork. While the dish is very flavor full the noodles can be considered a little doughy and heavy which is the standard in the more northern areas of China."
