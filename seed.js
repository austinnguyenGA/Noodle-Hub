    review:'With Olive Garden its always hit or miss. Sometimes the noodles are slightly burned sometimes the sauce is a bit to heavy or sometimes theres not enough. In general for this dish the sauce is to heavy and sometimes the shrimp and scallops that comes with this dish are over cooked. I would not recommend this dish the next time you go to your local Olive Garden.'
